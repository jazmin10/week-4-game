# jQuery to the Rescue

### Overview

For this project, I created another fun and interactive game for web browsers. This time, the app dynamically updates HTML with the jQuery library. 

### How the Game Works

* There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
* The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
* When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score
    * Note: The game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal. 
* The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
* The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
* The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
    * Note: When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values.
* The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, the page should not refresh as a means to restart the game.
